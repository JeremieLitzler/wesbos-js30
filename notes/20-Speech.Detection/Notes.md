## Instructions

Synthetise speech to text.
We will create a new paragraph to contain what the speech recognition captured.

When the speaker stops, we append a new paragraph to the DOM.

## What I learned

- Speech recognition is not excellent, yet it is mature enough to play with it.
- Use vocal command to tell the browser is fun but time consumming ;)
