## Instructions

Replicate the menu interactivity of [Stripe menu](https://stripe.com/) when hovering the main menu items.

Per Wes's example, we will want all links in the sample page to work with a highlight "bubble" that transition from the previously highlighted link to the new one.

The bubble is a dynamic element that is positionned from the previous hovered link to the next.
By default is not visible.

The sub-menu part will be dealt in [exercice 26](../26-Stripe.Follow.Along.Nav/Notes.md)
