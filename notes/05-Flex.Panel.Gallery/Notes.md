In the exercice, I have played with the `transitionend` events once more.

The tip is that logging `event.propertyName` will give all the events happening because often, there is not a single event but several.

Also, it is important to test on all browsers because, like Safari on the `flex-grow` event, the implementation of the browsers may very likely differ.
