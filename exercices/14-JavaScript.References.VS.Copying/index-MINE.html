    let num2 = num;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Jeremie";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    //=> both arrays are updated!
    //=> oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const teamTrueCopy = Array.from(players);
    console.log(teamTrueCopy);
    teamTrueCopy[3] = "Joseph";
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teamTrueCopy2 = players.map(player => player);
    console.log(teamTrueCopy2);
    teamTrueCopy2[3] = "Joseph";
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teamTrueCopy3 = [...players];
    console.log(teamTrueCopy3);
    teamTrueCopy3[3] = "Joseph";
    console.log(players, teamTrueCopy, teamTrueCopy2, teamTrueCopy3);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person.name = "Not Wes Bos";
    console.log(person, person2); //ah, person2 
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);
    person3.name = "Really Wes Bos?";
    console.log("person3", person3);
    console.assert(person3.name === "Really Wes Bos?");
    console.log("person", person);
    console.assert(person.name === "Not Wes Bos");
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
